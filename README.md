![MongoDB Logo](images/Mongodb-Icon.png)
## **Introduction**

In the rapidly growing world of data, where information flows at unprecedented speeds, there is a critical need for robust tools to organize, analyze, and extract knowledge. This is where **MongoDB**, a flexible and scalable document-based database system, comes into play, offering innovative solutions for managing complex datasets.

This project, **AirlineDB**, aims to explore the capabilities of MongoDB in building a flight management application designed to simplify trip planning and organization for travelers, whether individuals or groups. The goal is to meet the diverse needs of travelers by providing an easy-to-use database and advanced features.

### **Challenges Addressed**
- **Information Overload:** The abundance of online information makes it difficult for travelers to find accurate and reliable details about destinations, transportation options, accommodations, and activities.
- **Planning Complexity:** Successful trip planning requires precise coordination between various aspects such as booking flights, accommodations, transportation, and activities, which can be time-consuming and effort-intensive.

We will use **MongoDB (Compass & Shell)** to create a robust and scalable database for storing flight-related data. Along the way, we will face challenges such as:
- Designing an efficient database that meets the application's diverse needs while maintaining performance and efficiency.

## **Indexing for Performance**

Indexes are crucial in MongoDB to improve query performance. Below are the proposed indexes for **AirlineDB**:

| Collection    | Field(s)              | Reason                                                                 |
|---------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Planes**    | `planeTypeId`         | Links pilots to the aircraft they are qualified to fly.               |
| **Captains**  | `planeType`           | Links captains to the aircraft types they are qualified to operate.   |
| **Passengers**| `passengerName`, `CityID` | Improves search speed when looking up passengers by name and city.    |
| **Departures**| `CaptainID`, `PlaneID`| Links flights to assigned captains and aircraft.                      |
| **Reservations**| `passengerId`, `price` | Tracks reservations based on passenger ID and ticket price.           |
